Send BuddyPress HTML Emails via WordPress Mail system.

== Description ==

BuddyPress has a fantastic email templating system. Unfortunately, as soon as you use any third party plugin the BuddyPress stops sending their HTML templates and sends a basic text version of emails. 
This plugin is for users who want to use WP Mail system for sending HTML templates. It works with plugin relay and transactional email services Like Mandrill, Mailgun, SendInBlue, Amazon SES,mailjet etc.

This plugin will bypass BuddyPress PHP Mailer and use WordPress's inbuilt WP Mail for sending BuddyPress HTML Emails.
